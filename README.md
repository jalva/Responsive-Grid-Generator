# Responsive-Grid-Generator
If you ever need to declare responsive layouts on the server-side (for example using a CMS) then this component will give you just that.
Using the Responsive Grid Generator you can use a single ASP.Net Core View Component which will render any custom responsive grid layout.
This responsive grid layout view component will accept (as its model) a list of child partial views that will serve as the content rendered
inside the gird's responsive columns. 

This component uses a simple declarative approach to define the responsive grid. 
The responsive grid is based on the Bootstrap 2 grid consisting of 12 columns.
Just as in Bootstrap 2, there are 4 CSS breakpoints: Lg, Md, Sm and Xs.
In order to declare the responsive grid using this component, you will need to provide the layout metadata for each of the screen sizes above.
The layout metadata describes the pattern in which to render your custom content inside the responsive grid.

For example, in order to render the following layout, assuming you have 9 partial views to display in Lg screens:

![responsive layout](https://github.com/jalva/Responsive-Grid-Generator/blob/master/responsive-grid-layout-example.PNG)
      
You would use the following syntax to describe such a grid layout: 

**0=12&1=6,6&2=4,4,4**

The above line describes the grid layout in one of the 4 css breakpoints (screen sizes). Let's break it down into the query string components:

* 0=12 - first row has one content column which is full width (col-*-12)
* 1=6,6 - second row has two content columns which are of equal width (col-*-6)
* 2=4,4,4 - third row has three content columns which are of equal width (col-*-4)

So the above layout query string describes a layout pattern consisting of 3 rows with the content columns described above. 
Such a query string layout metadata has to be defined for all 4 screen sizes (Lg, Md, Sm and Xs). 
*These responsive pattern query strings* only require you to specify the unique rows in the layout pattern. 
For example, the above layout query string will repeat itself on a list of partial views of any length. 
If there are more custom views to render than columns defined in the layout query string, then the pattern will repeat itself on the list of custom views (as shown in the snapshot).

The grid generator doesn't care how many actual partial views it needs to render, it will apply the defined responsive pattern on any number of custom views passed.

The [following file](https://github.com/jalva/Responsive-Grid-Generator/blob/master/WebAppWithGridGenerator/Views/Home/Index.cshtml) contains the code that renders the **'GridContainer'** view component passing to it the responsive layout query strings as well as the partial views to render along with their coreesponding view models:

```
@await Component.InvokeAsync("GridContainer", new GridLayoutContainer_ViewModel
            {
                Lg_Row_Indx_To_Col_Sizes_Csv = "0=12&1=6,6&2=4,4,4", // for large screen sizes use the pattern: 1 row with 1 column (col-lg-12), 1 row with 2 columns of equal width (col-lg-6), 1 row with 3 columns of equal width (col-lg-4)
                Md_Row_Indx_To_Col_Sizes_Csv = "0=4,6,2&1=4,8", // for medium screen sizes use the pattern: 1 row with 3 columns (col-md-4 and col-md-6 and col-md-2), 1 row with 2 columns (col-md-4 and col-md-8)
                Sm_Row_Indx_To_Col_Sizes_Csv = "0=6,6", // for small screen sizes use the pattern: 1 row with 2 columns of equal width (col-sm-6)
                Xs_Row_Indx_To_Col_Sizes_Csv = "0=12", // for xsmall screen sizes use the pattern: 1 row with 1 column (col-xs-12)
                
                ColumnPartialsWithModels = new List<Tuple<string, object>>
                {
                    new Tuple<string, object>("Shared/Partials/Card", new Card_ViewModel
                    {
                        ImgUrl = "/images/profile.png",
                        Title = "Title 1",
                        Subtitle = "Subtitle 1",
                        DescriptionParagraphs = new List<string>
                        {
                            "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas in justo ligula. Nulla facilisi. Morbi non tellus vel augue commodo condimentum ac vitae metus.",
                            "Proin vel ipsum vel erat porta porttitor. Sed urna libero, placerat et aliquet eget, facilisis quis ante. Pellentesque congue laoreet mattis. "
                        },
                        DetailsUrl = "#"
                    }),
                    new Tuple<string, object>("Shared/Partials/Card", new Card_ViewModel
                    {
                        ImgUrl = "/images/profile.png",
                        Title = "Title 2",
                        Subtitle = "Subtitle 2",
                        DescriptionParagraphs = new List<string>
                        {
                            "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Maecenas in justo ligula. Nulla facilisi. Morbi non tellus vel augue commodo condimentum ac vitae metus.",

                        },
                        DetailsUrl = "#"
                    }),
                    ... rest of the custom views 
```
